Chapter 3 Arrays Solutions to Tutorial Problems
================

(3.1) 

(a) Discussed in the lecture; 

(b) String literal:

#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>

main()
{
    char string[] = "NUS";
    printf("the size of %s (expressed in # of bytes) is %d and the length is %d\n\n", string, sizeof(string), strlen(string));

    strcpy(string, "Clementi");

    printf("the size of %s (expressed in # of bytes) is %d and the length is %d\n\n", string, sizeof(string), strlen(string));
    return 0;
}


Another Example for you to test and run!

/* Use this code to run and learn!  use - pythontutor,com
Each item below is a separate expt below.

(1) first run as such and observe the way memory contents are 
displayed; 
(2) now change array[5] tp array[6] and run and see! 
(3) Now use array[5]; Release the 3 lines from: char test[6] 
and the next 2 lines and see what it does! You might have seen 
an error! GO back and change to array[6] and run and see. 

Message: If you attempt to use string.h functions then a string 
need to end with a '\0' character. Or else it will be simply 
treated as an array of characters. Remember this property! 

=================== */
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>

int main() {
  char array[5] = "abcde";
  char string[] = "abcde";
  /* char test[6];
  strcpy(test,array);
  printf("Test string = %s\n",test); */
  printf("array = %s\n",array);
  printf("string = %s\n",string);
  return 0;
}
